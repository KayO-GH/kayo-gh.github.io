The Africa Youth Employment Clock is a Mastercard Foundation project executed by the [World Data Lab](https://worlddata.io/) (WDL) to track and predict employment trends in Africa, and help policy-makers to make data-sriven decisions. At WDL, I led the data engineering and data science work for Ghana and Nigeria with sub-national granularity, including data acquisition, modelling and visualization, as well as presentations at the international launch events.

### UNet Foreground Image Segmentation

<img width="800" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-21 at 17 24 19" src="https://github.com/KayO-GH/kayo-gh.github.io/assets/18174012/601f9242-fdc7-4ba1-a36b-ab8649316cc8">

A TensorFlow project from 2020 using a modified UNet autoencoder architecture with MobileNetV2 weights to perform transfer learning for foreground image segmentation. The original usecase was polyp segmentation from colonoscopy images, but this was repurposed for foreground segmentation of everyday objects.
