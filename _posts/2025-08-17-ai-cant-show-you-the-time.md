Apparenntly this is a thing that a lot of people already knew, but I heard it on day 1 of the Deep Learning Indaba 2025 as a passing comment: generative AI models cannot (almost 100%) produce images of analogue clock faces with any time other than 10 past 10.

This is strictly an image problem, which is why I used to word "show", not "tell" in the title of this article.

Speaking of show and tell, let me just show you an example of what I mean from everybody's favourite PhD-level thinker, ChatGPT.
