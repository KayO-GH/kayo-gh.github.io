#### The Problem
Apparently this is a thing that a lot of people already knew, but I heard it for the first time in August last year, on Day 1 of the Deep Learning Indaba 2025 as a passing comment: generative AI models cannot (almost 100%) produce images of analogue clock faces with any time other than 10 past 10.

This is strictly an image problem, which is why I used to word "show", not "tell" in the title of this article.

Speaking of show and tell, let me just show you an example of what I mean from everybody's favourite PhD-level thinker, ChatGPT.

*Now, [ChatGPT does not allow us to embed shared chats](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/101cb7e/anyone_figured_out_how_to_put_chatopenaicom/), so you can either follow along with the screenshots below, or look at tht chat [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/68a1fde5-669c-8007-aeca-684bbebd3510). The screenshot route is better if I say so myself.*

So let's begin. Simple first ask:


Well done, ChatGPT. On to my simple second ask:

Wait, what? Come on. It's not that hard. Let me explain better...

At this point, despite being adequately warned, I could not help but feel like ChatGPT was being an idiot. I knew why (we will discuss the 'why' shortly) it was behaving this way, but as far as feelings are concerned I was disgusted by the performance of this billion-dollar oaf.

And so I switched my approach. Surely, ChatGPT should be able to draw the correlation between digital and analogue time. I tried to give our beloved ChatGPT one more shot...
