#### Xam Xamlé in Sunny Senegal!

Anyway, it's been a year already since the Deep Learning Indaba in Senegal, and another edition is upon us in beautiful Rwanda 🇷🇼, my second home.

Last year's theme was Xam Xamlé (meaning "To gain knowledge and share it", in Wolof, I think), which truly embodies the DLI's culture of democratizing knowledge in the African AI space.

Better blog posts have been written on the 2024 Indaba by very active participants in the community; like [this](https://deeplearningindaba.com/blog/2025/04/xam-xamle-our-latest-indaba-impact-report/), and [this](https://medium.com/@amal.nammouchi12/the-hums-after-the-applause-reflecting-on-the-deep-learning-indaba-2024-66b0d3fbcf1a), or maybe [this one](https://medium.com/@amal.nammouchi12/africlimate-ai-participation-at-the-deep-learning-indaba-2024-from-a-spark-to-a-community-469c5ae7b166?source=user_profile_page---------4-------------15305e64a0ec----------------------) or even [these](https://deeplearningindaba.com/blog/2024/08/). So all I will offer today is my two cents on what makes the DLI a great conference, and what you should look out for to make the most of the event.

#### 1. Pracs (Now called Learnathons)
Pracs (short for practicals) are a gem of the Deep Learning Indaba. Imagine having access to high-quality hands-on machine learning tutorials on state-of-the-art topics with functional base code; fully explained 🤯! That's an Indaba prac!

"Where is this precious gem?" you ask. Freely available on the [DLI Github](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba)! Here's a direct [link to the 2025 pracs](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2025). You're welcome!

If you're making it to the Indaba, install all the necessary packages and libraries in advance so you don't waste valuable learning time with the instructors running `pip installs` on potentially unstable internet.

Here's a final note. Pracs have been rebranded as learnathons this year, and will be extended beyond the single onsite sessions. Here's the official memo in the `readme` for this year's prac:  
In past years, we had **one-off** practicals covering many topics — exciting, but often rushed ⏳.  
This year, we’re all about **depth, skills, and real progress** 📈:

> - 🗓 **Multi-session tracks — now called Learnathons** 📚🔥:  
>   - **Part 1** → Live, **onsite** during Indaba 🎤  
>   - **Parts 2–4** → **Online** after Indaba 🖥, so you can practise, grow your skills, and gain confidence with the topic over several weeks.
> 
> - 🏆 **Certificates & prizes**: Attend **80%+** of your Learnathon → earn an **Indaba Certificate** 📜 + possible **sponsor prizes** 🎁.  
> 
> - 🌍 **Community meetups**: Exploring **physical locations** in some countries for the online sessions (**TBA**) 📍.  
> 
> - 🌐 **English & French** for the onsite practicals 🗣.

If you prefer the old formats, you can always revisit the [2024 prac](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2024). That content is not totally out of date... yet. 🤭
